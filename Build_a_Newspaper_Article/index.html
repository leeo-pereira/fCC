            Mild-mannered librarian Harold Pickles has become the unlikely face of backyard justice after a group of squirrels allegedly destroyed his prize-winning tomatoes for the third time this season. “I was willing to let the first raid slide,” Pickles told The Daily Panic, while adjusting a helmet made from a colander. “But when they gnawed my heirlooms and left nothing but smug acorns behind, that was an act of war.”

            Witnesses report seeing Pickles crawling through his backyard bushes at dawn, whispering tactical plans into a walkie-talkie connected only to his cat, Chairman Meow. While some neighbors have expressed concern, others are supportive. “Honestly, it’s the most excitement we’ve had since the Wi-Fi went out last summer,” said local resident Donna Trigg. Town officials have asked Pickles to “de-escalate the produce conflict,” but so far, his only response has been a sign reading, “No Nuts Shall Pass.”
