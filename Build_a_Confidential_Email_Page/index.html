        <p>Dear Agent,</p>
        <p>I hope this message finds you hidden under a nondescript trench coat, sipping lukewarm coffee from a mug labeled <span class="subscript">“World's Okayest Spy.”</span> We have a situation on our hands, codename: <span class="blurred">Lunchbox</span>. Intelligence reports indicate someone has been stealing sandwiches from the office fridge. We suspect it's either <span class="blurred">Jenkins</span> from Accounting or an unusually agile raccoon. Either way, trust is compromised—and possibly mayonnaise.</p>
        <p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it <span class="subscript">(and let's be honest, you don't have much of a choice—budget cuts and all)</span>, is to initiate covert surveillance. Utilize the standard toolkit: motion sensors, decoy snacks, and that fake <span class="blurred">plant</span> we all pretend is decorative but has more wires than the IT department. Remember: blend in. Wear business casual. Feign interest in small talk. Resist the urge to monologue.</p>
        <p>In the event you're captured or mistaken for an actual employee, we will disavow any knowledge of your identity—except Karen in HR, who will still expect you to fill out a timesheet. Proceed with caution. Trust no one. And if you must confront the target, please do it after lunch. We can't risk another spilled yogurt incident.</p>
